 

Personal passion project
2020-2021

## 1.0 Preliminary investigation
For 5 weeks you will be challenged to produce a project to your own liking. Find a pain point, Ideate around that pain point, Produce a high fidelity prototype that will illustrate the purpose of your project. Additionally, Thinking about my user group is a key factor.
To realize this project I will need to ask myself “what kind of a developer am I?” What are my personal interests? What are the current development trends that became reality? And how will I integrate that into my personal passion project? Which pain points are currently not tackled? Or which pain points have been created by another technology? Is it possible in 5 weeks? etc
Having answers to these questions will help me a lot in creating a well constructed personal passion project that I will be happy with and determined about.
The first question I’ll ask myself is which trends are a good base to build upon?
1.1 Trend Research

What is Tensorflow 2.0?

Health care mixed with IoT seems like a good trend/opportunity to work in?
Which kind of technology would be crucial to learn?
AutoCAD software (udemy will give a helping hand)
3d printer
Tensorflow to recognize certain trained models. 
Arduino, johnny-five
React-native or swift
Knowledge about robotics and microcontrollers

An example of a well-executed project with the knowledge above:

Prosthetics are not an option because scientists and engineers are busy with that topic. It would be not original. A unique pain point is required that has the opportunity to make (a little) change in the medical world.
1.2 Who am I as a developer?
I am interested in constructing machine learning projects that seem to be impossible. I am a developer who likes to go outside his comfort zone and will take risks to learn and develop more as a developer. I am a perfectionist in development. So the agile working method is sometimes all over the place but my research skills learned me to stay on edge for that problem. How would I see myself making something I would love?
Making something innovative in health care
Trying to better the world with my Devine creativity
Machine learning/robotics/engineering would be my passion
Machine learning mixed with an app would be a passion
Spreading awareness with an innovative solution
What does inspire me?

Kursgezagt combines philosophy with science which often leads to inspirational and educative experiences. I want to turn this inspiration into something that will inspire others in the development world. But this channel covers a lot of pain points/technologies that are quite interesting.
Pain points that this channel covers:
Banking
AI
Machines



## 2.0 Official Idea
## 2.1 Pain point
My dad is almost turning 57 years old. Sadly, He’s getting old, grumpy, and especially in these times quite lonely. When I’m working in the garden he often screams at his lawnmower that there's always something going on with that thing. He kicks/curses at it and he quotes that “I am getting too old for this shit”, “Why can’t grass cut itself”. He also complains that he cannot see his friends during these troubling times
It’s fair to say he is kinda getting fed up... 
If he had just the alternative that I could give him for his 57th birthday where he won’t feel lonely and so that he does not to cut his grass anymore
2.2 Ideation
My plan is to make him his own personal automatic lawn mower buddy for his birthday. This way he can cuss at it all he wants. The robot will actually understand his gestures/sounds and will respond accordingly to some chosen secondary behaviours. Like coming to close. Passing by, talking, etc. 







## 3.0 Approach
## 3.1 scope
This is a really big project. But I researched it and I don’t have to start from scratch. Guides and everything is found online. My job is to make this robot more human-like. Like we’ve seen in research. Applying my research would be the key factor in this project.

On the other hand, The project is going to cost me a lot of money. Around 300 euros. But it’s for a present, So I’ll cope with that. I think it’s possible to complete in 6 weeks’ time especially when I have the blueprint at hand. An integration of TensorFlow and Arduino will be required.
I prepared for such projects in the summer of 2020.
I made a bionic hand that would prepare me to make bigger projects + I am very passionate about this.

This data will help me through the first three weeks of the project.

This blog/blueprint will help me on my way to complete the construction phase of my schedule for the remix of my humanized robot. 
This data will help me through the second three weeks of the project.

https://blog.arduino.cc/2019/10/15/get-started-with-machine-learning-on-arduino/
The research I did for colbot / blog posts and documentation on how to mix arduino with tensorflow will help me on my way to perform the machine learning phase of the project with a sense ble microcontroller. This will be an easy integration in tensorflow.

What will I have learned/accomplished
I will be become an arduino enthusiast when I complete this project
Tensorflow will dominate the market in 2021. I hope this project will let me gain a lot of knowledge on this technology
Delivering my dad a beautiful present for his birthday
How to work with autoCAD software to make my own designs
And ofcourse a beautiful looking lawn.



## 3.2 scheme
3 weeks of construction
First week: Preparation
Ordering the parts/blueprints
Learning AutoCAD with a udemy course
Designing the remixed version with AutoCAD
3d printing all the parts
Second week: Construction
Construction robot
Time for problem-solving
Electrical installation
Third week: making it functional
Finishing the second week if not completed
Uploading the code
Fixing bugs
Solving problems with the code

3 weeks of Machine learning
First week: Learning TensorFlow
Researching TensorFlow (applying my research from Colbot)
Ordering parts
Prototype experiments
Second week: Tensorflow - Arduino
Applying TensorFlow models to my robot (speech recognition, etc)
Third week: Finetune/breathing room
A week for fine tuning, adjustments tests, room to breath. Making a movie

4.0 Research questions
I will make a remix of the CAD data that I downloaded from the thingiverse website. How will I make a computer-aided remix of the design that is fit for my purpose?

In the blueprint of this device, There are a lot of components that are not meant for starters. What is the functionality of these components and in which scenarios would you use them?

Personally, Week 5 was a very interesting week for me. How would I mix machine learning libraries and tools such as TensorFlow in an Arduino project?

The research question of how I would make the robot more human with a personality has already been answered in the colbot research I did for my minor which is a huge time saver.
