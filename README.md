## strenghts
But, what are the strenghts of this technology?
* Instant reaction time 20ms
* No internet connection required
* Ble senseboard has tons of sensors that is very interesting for IOT
* Make machine learning models with the sensordata
* A lot of potential for the future
* Trendresearch indicates that this will be a major breakthrough in IOT in 2021 if neural networks/models can be smaller in file size or the chip can access more data.

Exploring this the field of tinyML is our core challenge. 
But how can I apply this technology into a creative personal passion project?

## Combining powers
Week01 arduino mixed with week05 machine learning
Those 2 weeks are the weeks where i am most passionate about.
Week03 unity3d was also a week where I was looking forward to.
So adding a gamification factor can be a possibility. 

## Goal (objectives)
* Gamification
* Arduino (exploring new components)
* Machine learning (tinyML with tensorflow lite)
