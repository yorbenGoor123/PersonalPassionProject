## Core challenge
The usage of tinyML in a creative project that highlights the strenghts of these technologies.

## strenghts
But, what are the strenghts of this technology?
* Instant reaction time 20ms
* No internet connection required
* Ble senseboard has tons of sensors that is very interesting for IOT
* Make machine learning models with the sensordata
* A lot of potential for the future
* Trendresearch indicates that this will be a major breakthrough in IOT in 2021 if neural networks/models can be smaller in file size or the chip can access more data.

Exploring this the field of tinyML is our core challenge. 
But how can I apply this technology into a creative personal passion project?

## Combining powers
Week01 arduino mixed with week05 machine learning
Those 2 weeks are the weeks where i am most passionate about.
Week03 unity3d was also a week where I was looking forward to.
So adding a gamification factor can be a possibility. 

## Goals (objectives)
* Gamification
* Arduino (exploring new components)
* Machine learning (tinyML with tensorflow lite)
* Multiplayer based

## ideation
A multiplayer/ strategy game, where you place two smart driving robots in a homemade ring. You're objective is to coach your robot to victory by trying to push/force the oponent out of the ring.


But how exactly do we utilise the core challenge?
The BLE sense comes into play. 
* It can detect different sound commands and respond accordingly: eg: say attack and the robot will locate the opponent and drive forward. defense will do the contrary.
* It can detect when it loses by falling out of the ring and this will update the score on a optional lcd module.
* You can connect your phone to the bleSense with bleutooth.  This opens up new optional opportunities
* Detecting proximity of nearby objects could also be a possiblity.

In short, the robots can sense their surroundings with help of machine learning models (tensorflow LITE) and the BLE sense board.

## Advantages
* TinyML has a lot of opportunity in the ideation phase
* Cost profficient
* focussing on development part instead of the CAD designs and 3d printing
* Gamification is present
* Agile working method is possible instead of waterfall working method
* All feedback (pitch + coaching) is implemented
* Decent scope

## Disadvantages
* The concept where a robot pushes another robot off a platform has already been done in Japan. It's called robot Sumo.
